	<h1><b>I like to go swimming in the summer.</b></h1>
	<p>
		Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining <br>
		and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an <br>
		impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are three reasons I like to swim:
		<ul>
			<li> I get lots of exercise</li>
			<li> I enjoy the freedom</li>
			<li> I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
		</ul>
